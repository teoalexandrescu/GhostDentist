# Ghost Dentist

## General Description
Ghost Dentist is a 2D game inspired by Crocodile Dentist. A ghost with theeth will appear on the screen once the game starts. One of those teeth wil be randomly selected as being a cursed tooth.
Players will select the ghost's teeth using a arduino joystick, and they will have 30 seconds to choose teeth until the timer runs out. The goal of the game is to select as many good teeth, before the 
timer runs out, or before selecting the cursed tooth. If a player selects a good tooth, a green LED on the arduino will light up. If they slect the cursed tooth, a red LED will light up, the ghost
will become angry, and then both LED's will alternatively flash signaling that the game is over. 

## Technologies
- p5.js
- Arduino
- Tone.js

## Future Goals
- Add sound effect when selecting a tooth
- Add more background sprites
- Make the background sprites interactive
- Add more characters in the game for example a vampire
- Add 3 lives, each time a player loses a life, the main character of the game switches (ex: from ghost to vampire)
- Add a restart by pressing the spacebar option
